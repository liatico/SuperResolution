The purpose of this project was to get familiar with construction and training of fully convolutional networks.
we specifically use the task of image super-resolution, and construct several different architectures and compare the results achieved by each of them.
this project takes images in size (72,72) and tries to infer pixels using deep learning
it outputs images in size (144,144) and (288,288)
